The folder contains the python code that uses Keras for implementing autoencoders for: 
Outlier Detection: Detect malicious login attempts using autoencoders: 
      The code contained reads the dataset of predetermined normal and malicious login attempts and scales each of the features using minmax function from SciKit Learn in range [0, 1]. The autoencoder built using Keras is trained and tested with the divided dataset to set a threshold between normal and malicious login attempts. The code uses varying parameters in the model(number of hidden layers, number of nodes per layer, activation functions, cost function, optimization algorithm and the impact of regularization, batch normalization and dropout) for the model to find the best confusion matrix, and thus the best separation threshold. It is suggested that the cross-entropy loss function in the present version be replaced with MSE.
